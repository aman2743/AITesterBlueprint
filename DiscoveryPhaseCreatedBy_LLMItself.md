gemini.md
 and 
task_plan.md
:

Scope: Are we converting single .java files one-by-one, or do you need to scan an entire folder structure?  
Target Language: Do you prefer the output to be TypeScript (recommended for Playwright) or JavaScript?  
LLM Configuration: Which Local LLM model do you plan to use with Ollama (e.g., codellama, llama3, mistral)?  
Application Type: Should this be a Web Interface (where you paste code/upload files) or a CLI tool? (Given the "Web Application Development" context, a Web App is assumed, but please confirm).
